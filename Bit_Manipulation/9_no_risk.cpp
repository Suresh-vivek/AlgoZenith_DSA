/*
Baburao Ganpatrao Apte a.k.a “Babu Bhaiya” created a new strong password for his locker, to save his money from Raju, who is promising to double his money in 21 days! :P

The new password z is a positive integer of at most 19 digits. Babu Bhaiya is bad at remembering passwords and doesn't want to take risks ( as he says “ bilkul ricks nhi lena ka ” ), so he divided his integer password into 2 positive integers a and b, such that z = a + b, and wrote down a&b and a|b values in his diary.

As expected, he forgot his password after a few days. Help him to retrieve his password z. 

It is given that a&b should be a sub-mask of a|b.

Input Format
The input contains a single line having a&b and a|b values.

Output Format
Output a single integer z, the password. 

Constraints
z is a positive integer of at most 19 digits and less than LLONG_MAX.
a&b should be a sub-mask of a|b.
Sample Input 1
1 7
Sample Output 1
8


observation  z = a&b + a|b
